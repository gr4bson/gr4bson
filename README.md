- 👋 Hi, I’m @gr4bson
- 👀 I’m interested in using Python for data mining and web development
- 🌱 I switched from finance to programming a few months ago and haven't looked back.
- I've already completed around 500 hours of Python courses. Currently working on my own web application and taking on more Python courses.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on best learning practices, finding good online courses and other knowledge sources.
